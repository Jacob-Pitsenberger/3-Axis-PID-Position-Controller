Updated the X/Y PID controllers to strengthen lateral stability by increasing the proportional gain to 100, adding a small integral term with tight limits to counter IMU bias, and expanding output limits to ±60 for improved authority. These adjustments build on the previous test results and prepare the system for the next refinement step, where velocity‑based damping will be introduced to further reduce drift and improve hover performance.
